N3DS Instagram Poster
=======

This is a homebrew app for the N3DS that I am developing to allow users to publish instagram posts from a photo taken on their 3ds.

I am utilising the libctru and devkit pro for this.

This is the client repo. It is not needed for this application however if you would like to run it yourself, the server application is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/hybriddap/Insta-3DS-Server).
